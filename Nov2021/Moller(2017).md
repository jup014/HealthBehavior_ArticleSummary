The third emerging research method we review, participants’ social networks, and their relative position and influence within such networks, offers researchers ways to ‘‘zoom out’’ and consider system-level features driving intervention success. Social network analysis can be used to help understand how individuals are influenced by friends, and how behavioral health interventions influence not only the targets of interventions but the targets’ friends.

Social network analytic methods are being used to model wide-ranging social networks, including intentionally-designed social networks dedicated to a specific health behavior (e.g., PatientsLikeMe.org) and open social networks (e.g., Facebook and Twitter; Centola, 2013).

Prior to the current widespread adoption of internet connected technologies, several decades of research using network analytic methods have established that individuals’ behavior and health status are heavily influenced by their ‘‘real world’’ social relationships and the social conditions guiding interpersonal interactions (e.g., Berkman & Syme, 1979; Christakis & Fowler, 2007). However, collecting data for the purpose of modeling the influence of an individual’s social network was prohibitively expensive for most behavioral health researchers. For example, the seminal work conducted by Christakis & Fowler (2007) used data from the famous and costly Framingham Heart Study, which involved hundreds of participants reporting the important members of their social networks at multiple time points over several decades. As the general public embrace large, online social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, and as digital health interventions incorporate these sites or provide access to their own dedicated online networking tools, collecting and modeling network data is becoming more affordable and feasible. Social network research has grown in popularity over the past few decades, and behavioral health interventions are increasingly acknowledging the importance of social influence on intervention success.

Social network analysis is defined here as the empirical study of how social networks influence individuals’ health behavior and outcomes, and it involves characterizing social relations around the individual (i.e., ties), and how properties of these connections (e.g., tie strength) and characteristics of friends/alters affect the individual/ego.

Social network analysis may also involve studying how structural properties of the network (e.g., network density) influence individuals’ health (Latkin & Knowlton, 2015).

Social networks are rarely considered in relation to the behavior change pathway, as illustrated in a review of obesity treatment interventions considering social relational constructs (Leroux et al., 2013). Among those that do, the pathway under study is most often social support, which is just one of many ways in which social networks exert their influence on individuals’ health (Berkman et al., 2000). Furthermore, although many interventions may be described as having taken a social network approach, most study the mechanisms connecting social networks to health, and do not conduct true social network analyses (Smith & Christakis, 2008).

Digital health interventions are especially well suited to true network analysis because they enable the collection of large quantities of social interaction data over time. These data can include participants’ interactions with their existing online connections/friends and/or interactions with others in the intervention. Capturing the digital traces that define online social network interactions enable digital health interventions to map a much larger portion of the social network than has been possible using traditional methods (e.g., via self-report surveys). Passively collected data from digital health interventions also make it easier for researchers to track engagement with communication tools and interactions among participants, potentially facilitating more accurate estimation of intervention effects (Hunter et al., 2015).

Network analyses using data from digital health interventions suggest that many network effects are consistent across online and offline social environments. For instance, recent evidence about the prevention of HIV and reduction of risky sexual behavior suggests that network effects observed in face-to-face trials extend to online settings such as Facebook (Young et al., 2014). Observational studies that have employed true network analyses have also demonstrated that social embeddedness in an online weight loss community affects weight loss (Poncela-Casasnovas et al., 2015), and that friends’ online behaviors (e.g., Facebook posting) affect adolescents’ drinking and smoking behavior (Huang et al., 2014). Digital health interventions that have taken a social network approach but not conducted true network analysis have demonstrated that social support, accountability, and a positive team environment are associated with improved health outcomes, including greater weight loss and increased physical activity over time (Carson et al., 2013; Leahey et al., 2012; Maher et al., 2015).

Although there is good evidence that online social networks can influence behavioral health, there is currently a dearth of research testing which behavior change techniques (BCTs) related to social interaction can be most effectively employed in digital interventions. In a recent review of how social network technologies were used in online health promotion, just under half of the studies evaluated were grounded in theory, and fewer still described how theories were specifically applied in delivering the intervention (Balatsoukas et al., 2015). Of the 93 BCTs in BCT Taxonomy v1, four relate to social interaction: those focused on social support, social comparison, social incentives, and restructuring of the social environment (Michie et al., 2014, 2015). Interventions could also focus on changing social norms within the network, or encouraging individuals to actively promote behavior change within their network as a strategy for changing their selfidentity (Latkin & Knowlton, 2015).

Future research should investigate how to maximize the potential for positive social network effects on health, specifically in the context of digital health interventions.

Examples of research questions to tackle are: (1) how users may interact or socialize using technology differently than in-person; for example, the Uses and Gratification framework considers how different features of social media are utilized based on users’ motivation for use and expectations about outcomes of use (Smock et al., 2011); (2) how human–computer interaction influences social network effects, and (3) to what extent computer-mediated communication is different from face-to-face communication in producing social network effects. Future work would also benefit from social network data collection that goes beyond individual approaches (i.e., collecting data just on the individual targeted by the intervention), and collects data from others in the participants’ networks (e.g., Facebook friends). This enables the evaluation of how the health and behavior of others (e.g., friends) affects people.

Collecting data on others also provides insight as to whether the intervention has spread beyond the participants targeted in the intervention, broadening the public health impact (i.e., social diffusion). However, in research trials, when social diffusion spreads to the control/non-intervention group(s), trials are said to suffer from ‘‘contamination.’’ Contamination may be especially prevalent in digital health interventions that provide opportunities for communication with other participants. A further research question to consider is how structural properties of individuals’ social networks influence behavioral health outcomes. For example, multiple sources of social reinforcement, available within clustered networks, may be necessary for optimizing healthy behavior change (Centola, 2013). These are just a few of the promising research directions for those using social network research methods for the purpose of intervention development and theory testing on digital platforms.
